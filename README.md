# Let's lunch

REST-API service that was done during the NoLabel Competition, which was held at ITMO University in Jan-Feb 2024. 

Idea - creating service for students, which could help them to communicate and make new connections through the lunch time (they can arrange a meeting with a stranger to get new acquaitances)

I took part in the process of Backend-development && testing the app. Our stack was: Golang, PostgresSQL, Docker, JWT (Json Web Token, used for user authorisation) && REST API principles for building an API.

In result, through our MVP service user can log in, create a meeting, delete meeting, join current ones, see the information about actual meeting.

All work, including documentation, database design and presentation to the jury, was fully completed by our team within 3 weeks.
